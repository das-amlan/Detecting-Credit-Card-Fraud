# Detecting-Credit-Card-Fraud
Developing a credit card fraud detection model using machine learning

## Aim of the project
The aim of this R project is to build a classifier that can detect credit card fraudulent transactions. I used a variety of machine learning algorithms like Decision Trees, Logistic Regression, Gradient Boosting Classifier that will be able to discern fraudulent from non-fraudulent ones.
