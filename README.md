# Detecting-Credit-Card-Fraud
Developing a credit card fraud detection model using machine learning

## Aim of the project
* The aim of this R project is to build a classifier that can detect credit card fraudulent transactions. I used a variety of machine learning algorithms like Decision Trees, Logistic Regression, Gradient Boosting Classifier that will be able to discern fraudulent from non-fraudulent ones.

* Also I wanted to learn how to use R markdown. It is a efficient way to represent your findings and helps to make your code more readable (explainable) to others
