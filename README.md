# Detecting Credit Card Fraud
## Overview
This project focuses on the development of a credit card fraud detection model using machine learning algorithms. The goal of this project is to build a classifier that can accurately identify fraudulent transactions. The implementation of the project is done using the R programming language.

## Algorithms Used
In this project, the following machine learning algorithms were used:

* Logistic Regression
* Decision Tree
* Gradient Boosting Classifier (GBM)

## Evaluation Metric
The model was evaluated based on Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve.

## R Markdown
The project was also an opportunity to learn R Markdown for presenting findings. R Markdown makes the code more readable and explainable to others and provides an efficient way to document the results.

### Why R Markdown
* Reproducibility: Easily reproduce results for others or for future reference.

* Efficient Documentation: Streamlines documentation of analysis, including code and output, in one place.

* Readability: Uses markdown syntax for easy formatting and better understanding of results.

* Dynamic outputs: Includes dynamic output such as plots and tables that automatically update as code changes.

* Valuable tool: Provides an efficient, reproducible, and readable way to document and present data analysis results.

## Conclusion
This project provided a hands-on experience in the development of a model for the detection of credit card fraud using machine learning algorithms in R. The results demonstrate the potential of these algorithms for the effective identification of fraudulent transactions.
